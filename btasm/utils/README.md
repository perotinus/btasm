* beautifier.pl - a code beautifier for BTASM source files.  
  * Good for making UbiSoft-given source files readable.
* bc_beautifier.sh – a code beautifier for BTASM bytecode files
  * Good for splitting bytecode on commands (most of the time)
  * NB - the length argument gets bunched in with if/else statements 
* test.pl – a testing script scaffold.  Not as useful anymore.
* test.sh – compares the results of the compiler with the source given by UbiSoft.
